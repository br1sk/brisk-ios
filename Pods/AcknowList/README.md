# AcknowList

_Ready to use “Acknowledgements”/“Licenses”/“Credits” view controller for [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/)._

_Written in Swift 3 (for Objective-C, you can use [VTAcknowledgementsViewController](https://github.com/vtourraine/VTAcknowledgementsViewController))._

## How to Install

This project is only useful if you use CocoaPods, so let’s assume that you’re indeed using CocoaPods.

1. Add `pod 'AcknowList'` in your `Podfile`.
2. Import the `Pods-acknowledgements.plist` file from the generated `Pods/Target Support Files` folder to your main app project (so you need to run `pod install` at least once before using this pod; don’t copy the file itself, just add a reference).  
This file is generated at `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-{project}/Pods-{project}-acknowledgements.plist`.  


## How to Use

The `AcknowListViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` swift
let viewController = AcknowListViewController()
if let navigationController = self.navigationController {
  navigationController.pushViewController(viewController, animated: true)
}
```


## Customization

If your `.plist` file is named something other than `Pods-acknowledgements.plist` (_e.g._ if you’re using fancy build targets), you can initialize the view controller with a custom path.

``` swift
let path = NSBundle.mainBundle().pathForResource("Pods-AcknowExample-acknowledgements", ofType: "plist")
let viewController = AcknowListViewController(acknowledgementsPlistPath: path)
```


## Requirements

AcknowList is written in Swift 3, requires iOS 8.0 and above, Xcode 8.0 and above, and uses ARC.
